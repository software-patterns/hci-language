## Robert Pirsig, _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_

**p. 16**

> "What's new?" is an interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which, if pursued exclusively,
results only in an endless parade of trivia and fashion, the silt of tomorrow. I would like, instead, to
be concerned with the question "What is best?," a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a
question whose answers tend to move the silt downstream.

**p. 24**

> The "it" is a kind of force that gives rise to technology, something undefined, but inhuman, mechanical,
lifeless, a blind monster, a death force. Something hideous they are running from but know they can never
escape. [. . .] Somewhere there are people who understand it and run it but those are technologists,
and they speak an inhuman language when describing what they do. [. . .] And their things, their monster
keeps eating up the land and polluting the air and lakes, and there is no way to strike back at it, and
hardly any way to escape it.

**p. 25**

> [. . .] the natural feelings of very many people are similar on this matter; so that when you look at
them collectively, as journalists do, you get the illusion of [. . .] an entire political antitechnological
left emerging, looming up from apparently nowhere, saying, "Stop the technology. Have it somewhere else.
Don't have it here." It is still restrained by a thin web of logic that points out that without the
factories there are no jobs or standard of living. But there are human forces stronger than logic. There
always have been, and if they become strong enough in their hatred of technology that web can break.

**p. 26**

> The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears
of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think
otherwise is to demean the Buddhaâ€”which is to demean oneself.

**p. 32**

> The shop was a different scene from the ones I remembered. The mechanics, who had once all seemed like
ancient veterans, now looked like children. A radio was going full blast and they were clowning around
and talking and seemed not to notice me. When one of them finally came over he barely listened to the
piston slap before saying, "Oh yeah. Tappets."

> After the third overhaul two months later they replaced the cylinders, put in oversize main carburetor
jets, retarded the timing to make it run as coolly as possible and told me, "Don't run it fast."

> It was covered with grease and did not start.

**p. 34**

> At 5 P.M. or whenever their eight hours were in, you knew they would cut it off and not have another thought
about their work. They were already trying not to have any thoughts about their work *on* the job. In their
own way they were achieving the same thing John and Sylvia were, living with technology without really having
anything to do with it. [. . .] They were involved in it but not in such a way as to care.

**p. 35**

> When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things.

**p. 75**

> Persons tend to think and feel exclusively in one mode or the other and in doing so they tend to misunderstand
and underestimate what the other mode is all about. But no one is willing to give up the truth as he sees it,
and as far as I know, no one now living has any real reconciliation of these truths or modes.

**p. 85**

> [. . .] a ghost which calls itself rationality but whose appearance is that of incoherence and
meaninglessness, which causes the most normal of everyday acts to seem slightly mad because of their
irrelevance to anything else.

**p. 97**

> The desk girl asked us if we owned those "groovy, dreamy motorcycles" outside the window and we both
laughed so hard she wondered what she had said wronng.

**p. 100**

> Precision instruments are designed to achieve an *idea*, dimensional precision, whose perfection is
impossible. There is no perfectly shaped part of the motorcycle and there never will be, but when you
come as close as these instruments will take you, remarkable things happen [. . .]. John looks at the
motorcycle and he sees steel in various shapes and has negative feelings about these steel shapes and
turns off the whole thing. I look at the shapes of the steel now and I see *ideas*. He thinks I'm
working on *parts*. I'm working on *concepts*.

**p. 101-2**

> The overall name of these interrelated structures, the genus of which the hierarchy of containment
and structure of causation are just species, is *system*. The motorcycle is a system. A *real*
system.
>
> To speak of certain government and establishment institutions as "the system" is to speak
correctly [. . .]. People arrive at a factory and perform a totally meaningless task from eight to
five without question because the structure demands that it be that way. There's no villain, no
"mean guy" who wants them to live meaningless lives, it's just that the structure, the system demands
it [. . .]
>
> But to tear down a factory [. . .] is to attack effects rather than causes [. . .]. The true system,
the real system, is our present construction of systematic thought itself [. . .]

**p. 102**

> [I]f a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then that
rationality will simply produce another factory.

**p. 113**

> The formation of hypotheses is the most mysterious of all the categories of scientific method. Where
they come from, no one knows.

**p. 114**

> "Nobody," [Einstein] said, "who has really gone into the matter will deny that in practice the world
of phenomena uniquely determines the theoretical system, in spite of the fact that there is no
theoretical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles."

(Notice what happens when you replace "phenomena" with "requirements" and imagine this and the subsequent
paragraphs are about agile software development.)

**p. 123-4**

> These terms "theoretic" and "esthetic" correspond to what Phaedrus later called classic and romantic
modes of reality and probably shaped these terms in his mind more than he ever knew. The difference is
that the classic reality is *primarily* theoretic but has its own esthetics too. The romantic reality is
*primarily* esthetic but has its theory too. The theoretic and esthetic split is between components
of a single world. The classic and romantic split is between two separate worlds. The philosophy book,
which is called _The Meeting of East and West_, by F. S. C. Northrop, suggests that greater cognizance
be made of the "undifferentiated aesthetic continuum" from which the theoretic arises.

**p. 125**

> The questions he had asked about infinite hypotheses hadn't been of interest to science because they
weren't scientific questions. Science cannot study scientific method without getting into a bootstrap
problem that destroys the validity of its answers.

**p. 150**

> I remember reading this for the first time and remarking about the analytic craftsmanship displayed.
> He avoided splitting the University into fields or departments [. . .]. He also avoided the
traditional split into students, faculty, and administration. [. . .] Phaedrus split it between
"the church" and "the location"

(The phrase "analytic craftsmanship" is interesting, because we don't often think of *analysis* itself
as a craft. But I believe (and _ZAMM_ makes the point) that it *is* a craft. Compare Christopher
Alexander on the House of Tiles in Mexico: craft is paying attention to distinctions that matter and
ignoring distinctions that don't, and that is exactly what Phaedrus does in this passage.)

**p. 152**

> You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting
that the sun is going to rise tomorrow.

**p. 155**

> It's not the technology that's scary. It's what it does to the relations between people, like callers
and operators, that's scary.

**p. 163**

> Like the split between art and art history. One does it and the other talks about how it's done and
the talk about how it's done never seems to match how one does it.

**p. 164**

> Science works with chunks and bits and pieces of things with the continuity presumed, and DeWeese
works only with the continuities of things with the chunks and bits and pieces presumed.

**pp. 165-6**

> "Peace of mind isn't at all superficial, really," I expound. "It's the whole thing. That which
produces it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance. What we call workability
of the machine is just an objectification of this peace of mind. [. . .] The material object of
observation, the bicycle or rotisserie, can't be right or wrong. [. . .] If the machine produces
tranquillity it's right."

> DeWeese asks, "What if the machine is wrong and I feel peaceful about it?"

> "What's more common is that you feel unpeaceful even if it's right [. . .]. You haven't completed
the ultimate requirement of achieving peace of mind because you feel these instructions were too
complicated and you may not have understood them correctly."

(Compare C.A.: "It is a subtle kind of freedom from internal contradictions.")

**p. 167**

> "The craftsman isn't ever following a single line of instruction. [. . .] The material and his
thoughts are changing together in a progression of changes until his mind's at rest at the same
time the material's right."

**p. 176**

> It seemed as though every rule [Phaedrus] honestly tried to discover with [his students] and
learn with them was so full of exceptions and contradictions and qualifications and confusions
that he wished he'd never come across the rule in the first place.

**p. 204**

> Mountains should be climbed with as little effort as possible and without desire. The reality of
your own nature should determine the speed. [. . .] To live only for some future goal is shallow.
It's the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here's where things grow.
>
> But of course, without the top, you can't have any sides. It's the top that *defines* the sides.

**p. 209**

> In time, however, he wondered *why* it worked, especially when he already knew it was irrational.
Why should an irrational method work when rational methods were all so rotten?

Compare Richard Gabriel on generative advice in squash: "The law of follow-through is hard to forget - itâ€™s a law, though, that makes little sense: where is its enchantment? How can advice about what to do after you hit a ball make any difference to what happens when you hit it, or before? 

**p. 217**

> Absence of Quality is the essence of squareness.

**p. 223**

> I think the referent of a term that can split a world into hip and square, classic and romantic, technological
and humanistic, is an entity that can unite a world already split along these lines into one. A real understanding
of Quality doesn't just serve the System, or even beat it or even escape it. A real understanding of Quality
*captures* the System [. . .].

**p. 233**

> Scientific materialism, which is commoner among lay followers of science than among scientists themselves, holds
that what is composed of matter or energy and is measurable by the instruments of science is real. Anything else
is unreal, or at least of no importance. "What you like"" is unmeasurable, and therefore unreal.

**p. 236**

> People disagreed about Quality because some just used their immediate emotions whereas others applied their
overall knowledge. [. . .] But this argument was completely devastating. [. . .] The hip-square cleavage he'd
discovered was still there, but Quality didn't now seem to fall entirely on one side [. . .].

AFAICT, the empirical evidence against unified Qualityâ€”that people disagree about itâ€”kind of makes it useless
as a philosophical concept. I lean towards replacing it with "caring" at this point, the obvious next question
being "what is it people should care about"? And the answer, of course, is "the whole thing, everything, but
especially the bit you're working on right now."

**p. 239**

> Quality is not a *thing*. It is an *event*.

> Quality is not just the *result* of a collision between subject and object. The very existence of subject
and object is *deduced* from the Quality event.

The more you care, the more aware you are of subjects and objects and their interrelation. I'm not sure
*how* exactly Quality produces subjects and objects, but it seems to. Lack of Quality, anecdotally,
produces feelings of dissociation. This isn't *qualia* I'm talking about, which is another thing entirely
and what I assumed Pirsig was getting mixed up with Quality when I first read this passage. Qualityâ€”whether
good or badâ€”produces awareness. If there's no good or bad to be aware of, awareness itself shuts down.

A world without quality is a world without either subjects or objects. A world without human life.

Machines can think. But do they care?

**p. 242**

> First you get the feeling, then you figure out why.

**p. 248**

> Now we had two different kinds of Quality but they no longer split Quality itself. They were
just two different time aspects of Quality, short and long.
