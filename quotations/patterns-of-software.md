> [. . .] we want to limit the use of abstraction
to either common items—common to every programmer—or items inextricably
linked to the application domain. Otherwise, unnecessarily abstracted code
would be unintelligible to programmers fresh to a project, and hence it would not
be habitable.

> What he learned about painting surprised me. I expected that the lessons
would talk about drawing skills and how to reproduce what you saw in reality by
attending to each detail in order to create an accurate reproduction. What he
learned instead was that by using the nature of the medium, the paint, the brush,
and brush strokes, he could create the same effects as those of reality through
reflected light and by the oil on canvas. So, instead—as I expected—of spending
hours painting each branch on a conifer, my father would dab and push with a
thick brush to create the effect of needled branches, and from a proper viewing
distance his conifers looked as real as real.

Care isn't enough to produce quality—you have to have technique, too.

> We have become used to almost fanatical precision in the construction
of buildings. Tile work, for instance, must be perfectly aligned,
perfectly square, every tile perfectly cut, and the whole thing accurate
on a grid to a tolerance of a sixteenth of an inch. But our tilework is
dead and ugly, without soul.
>
> In this Mexican house the tiles are roughly cut, the wall is not perfectly
plumb, and the tiles don’t even line up properly. Sometimes one
tile is as much as half an inch behind the next one in the vertical
plane.
>
> And why? Is it because these Mexican craftsmen didn’t know how
to do precise work? I don’t think so. I believe they simply knew what is
important and what is not, and they took good care to pay attention
only to what is important: to the color, the design, the feeling of one
tile and its relationship to the next—the important things that create
the harmony and feeling of the wall. The plumb and the alignment
can be quite rough without making any difference, so they didn’t
bother to spend too much effort on these things. *They spent their
effort in the way that made the most difference*. And so they produced
this wonderful quality, this harmony . . . simply because *that is
what they paid attention to, and what they tried to produce*.

> To get wholeness, you must try instead to
strive for this kind of perfection, where things that don’t matter are
left rough and unimportant, and the things that really matter are
given deep attention.
