> [. . .] we want to limit the use of abstraction
to either common items—common to every programmer—or items inextricably
linked to the application domain. Otherwise, unnecessarily abstracted code
would be unintelligible to programmers fresh to a project, and hence it would not
be habitable.

> What he learned about painting surprised me. I expected that the lessons
would talk about drawing skills and how to reproduce what you saw in reality by
attending to each detail in order to create an accurate reproduction. What he
learned instead was that by using the nature of the medium, the paint, the brush,
and brush strokes, he could create the same effects as those of reality through
reflected light and by the oil on canvas. So, instead—as I expected—of spending
hours painting each branch on a conifer, my father would dab and push with a
thick brush to create the effect of needled branches, and from a proper viewing
distance his conifers looked as real as real.

Care isn't enough to produce quality—you have to have technique, too.
