# workshop

This is a space for drafting and workshopping bits of software-related writing.

Currently, the ideas here center around a
[pattern language](https://groupworksdeck.org/pattern-language) for making humanizing computer systems.

Here, "humanizing" refers to the effect that computers should ideally have on people and their relationships with each other.
It does *not* imply "making computers more human-like".

# Why

See [why.md](./why.md).

# What

This repository:

- is public.
- will never be "finished" or publishable; rather, it is a community resource from which
  the raw materials of publishable works can be mined.
- is a space where we can let our weirdest and wildest ideas run loose.
  - *but please illustrate your weird ideas with lots of examples; it's hard to talk about ideas without something concrete to point to. —benchristel*

- Our scope includes code, software architecture, user interfaces, team dynamics, and open-source communities.
- Our quest is to seek [the quality without a name](https://onluminousgrounds.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/the-quality-without-a-name-part-one/).

# Who

*I'd like to consider the needs of various groups impacted by computer systems.
Users, nonusers, product owners, programmers, designers, sysadmins.
Whatever we end up writing, we have to make sure programmers are on board with it,
because they ultimately determine what gets built (and they'll likely be a large
part of our audience). But having multiple viewpoints
is vital. One possible goal of this work is to convince programmers that they can
live harmoniously in the world; that holding themselves to high ethical standards
is not stupid. —benchristel*

# Collaborating

This repository is structured in a way that I hope will encourage
collaborative, piecemeal growth.
- You can add a pattern to the [patterns directory](./patterns)
  by following [these instructions](./patterns/00_PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md).
- You can add links to the [References](./references.md) file.
- If you have feedback on a specific pattern, you can start a discussion, [wiki-style](http://wiki.c2.com/?PatternLanguage),
  in an italicized block or quote block within the pattern text itself. Below is an example of this.

> [benchristel] I prefer patterns to be concrete, specific, and grounded in our experiences.
Any positive experience you've had creating or using software is
a potential seed for a pattern. If you've also experienced
the pain of *not* having the pattern in your environment, so much the
better—that's evidence that the pattern actually does something. But you
don't need a lot of evidence to write the pattern. Patterns
can (should?) start out as just hypotheses; over time I'd like to test each
pattern more rigorously and see if it really holds up.

# Further Reading

The following resources help explain what patterns are all about.

- The [metapattern](./patterns/00_PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md).
- [Martin Fowler's "Writing Software Patterns"](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/writingPatterns.html)
- [_A Pattern Language_, by Christopher Alexander et al.](https://mythstyles.com/products/a-pattern-language-towns-buildings-construction-center-for-environmental). The original pattern language; this one is about physical architecture,
not software. The book is also available [as a PDF](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Ecological_Building/A_Pattern_Language.pdf).
