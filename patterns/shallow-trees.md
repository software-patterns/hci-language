# Shallow Trees

Hierarchies of all kinds—[people in a team](./community-of-peers.md),
dependencies of a package, and functions in a call graph—should be
shallow and wide.

**{Problem summary}**

{Problem description}

**Shallow hierarchies minimize the cost of change and communication**

{Solution description}

## Examples

This pattern manifests in many, many places:

- Company org charts
- Microservice architectures
- Package dependency graphs
- Function call graphs
- [Persistent data structures](http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/images/a/ab/HickeyJVMSummit2009.pdf)
- Directories and files in a project
- Namespacing of code units

Its ubiquity makes me think that it just might be 
one of the fundamental properties of [living structure](http://www.natureoforder.com/overview.htm)
in information systems.
