This pattern tells you how to structure the relationships among the people

**Most large software organizations have [a range of pay grades](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-levels-of-software-engineers-at-Google)
for individual contributors. But these are at best imprecise,
and at worst distracting and harmful.**

In reality, there is no single track of skills along which people progress.
Everyone has a unique background and set of skills.

Yet by labeling each person's set of expertise with a rank, companies
subtly reinforce the idea that person A is simply "more skilled" than
person B, for every skill related to their job—and that's almost never true.

*Personally, I tend to feel weird criticising someone's ideas when I can see that they have
a higher "rank" than me—and I'm less likely to take technical critique
seriously when it comes from someone of a lower "rank". This despite
the fact that I conciously believe this "ranks" are B.S. —benchristel*

**Base salaries on years of service, Adjust pay to local cost of living
and the employee's family situation—whether or not they have other people
to support. Instead of publicizing a pay grade for each employee, the company
directory can list the skills each person has mastered.**

Once our basic needs are met, additional money doesn't make us happier.
At the same time, it's preposterous and cruel to pay engineers a salary
that isn't sufficient to meet their basic needs. So monetary
compensation is not likely to be the factor that keeps a person at a company.

*What* does *make me want to stay at a company is feeling that my peers
appreciate me for my actual skills—not just the label that my manager has
deemed suitable for me.*

*I'm likely full of shit on this one. Someone explain to me why this is
a bad idea. —benchristel*
