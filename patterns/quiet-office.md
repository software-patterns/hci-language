**Open-plan offices do not work.**

[Todd] The research that I have seen that says open-plan offices do not work, study work patterns that are very different from Sustainable Software Development and Extreme Programming. Building software is different than running an HR group or selling insurance. The only software developement study that I'm aware of was done at Microsoft where they follow a very different style of software development. I'd love to see a study done on people who are doing something collaborative.

Cubicles are also bad, because they inhibit pairing. If you and I pair, it
has to either be in "my space" or "your space".
