# Neighborly Teams

This pattern tells you how arrange an office space to resolve the
tension between collaborative work and individuals' need for quiet and privacy.

**Open-plan offices do not work.**

[Todd] The research that I have seen that says open-plan offices do not work, study work patterns that are very different from Sustainable Software Development and Extreme Programming. Building software is different than running an HR group or selling insurance. The only software developement study that I'm aware of was done at Microsoft where they follow a very different style of software development. I'd love to see a study done on people who are doing something collaborative.

Cubicles are also bad, because they inhibit pairing. If you and I pair, it
has to either be in "my space" or "your space".

## Examples

> [benchristel] Schematics of spaces where I have worked:
>
> ### Office 1: A small startup (~10 employees)
>
> ```
> # = exterior wall
> | = window
> . = person
>
> #####################
> | .     .      .    #
> |                .  #
> | .      .  .       #
> #######     .    .  #
>       #             #
>       ###############
> ```
>
> In a space this compact, the whole company feels like one team. The downside of
> this type of space is that there is nowhere for people to go that is private.
> Everyone can see everyone else at all times. There were some... tense dynamics
> at this company.
>
> Though I could see natural light from my desk, I couldn't see outside. My desk was
> around the corner from the window.
>
> ### Office 2: A floor in a larger office (~100 workers)
>
> ```
> O = private or semi-private office 
> B = bathrooms
> E = elevator
> K = kitchenette
>
> ##------------------------##
> # O|  . . . . . . . .   |O #
> |__|  : : : : : : : :   |__|
> |  .  .             .  ..  |
> |  ....   ########  .....  |
> |  .....  ##B  E##  .....  |
> |  .....  ## K  ##  .....  |
> |  .....  ########  .....  |
> |  .....            .....  |
> |         . . . .          |
> #    : :  : : : : : :      #
> ##------------------------##
> ```
>
> In this office, teams sat together. There were no meeting rooms on this floor, so we
> had to walk a long way to go to meetings.
>
> People often worked remotely and would go home if they wanted some heads-down coding time.
> The office felt impersonal due to its sizeâ€”I had only a vague sense of what other teams'
> responsibilities were. I didn't know anyone personally outside my team.
> I didn't feel the lack of privacy was a big problem because I could work from home at any time.
>
> The office was ringed with windows so I had a nice view of mountains and sky from my desk.
>
> ### Office 3: A smaller office at a medium-sized company (~30 people)
>
> ```
> M = meeting room
> K = kitchen
> L.R = "living room" seating area
>
> #### Bathrms ####
> #  ###########  #
> #               #
> # ......  ,_____#
> # ......  |__M__#
> # ......  |__M__#
> # ......  |__M__#
> #               #
> #  K        L.R #
> #               #
> #---------------#
> ```
> 
> This office felt nice, if a bit cavernous. Though it had windows only on one side, they were fogged so
> there wasn't any glare. People could unplug their laptops and sit in the "living room" area if they
> wanted to get away from their desk. People occasionally paired here.
>
> One downside was that sales sat right next to engineering so there were usually several phone conversations
> going on within earshot of me at any given time.
>
> ### Office 4: A medium-sized office floor (~50 people)
> 
> ```
> O = private office
> K = kitchen
> M = meeting room
> S = sitting area
>
> #------------#--#--#--##

> This office had plenty of spots to work alone, and I used them frequently.
> This drawing only shows half the floor; the other half was support and marketing

> The teams are far apart enough to have acoustic isolation and partial visual isolation.

> The office is neither crowded, nor empty and dead.

> People have decorated the space around them in various simple ways. There is color.
