# A Theme of One's Own

This pattern tells you what aspects of software should be customizable,
and what aspects should be invariant, to give users a sense of
belonging and "home".

**To use only software designed by other people is to live your whole life in
hotel rooms.**

The rooms may be nice, comfortable, even lavish—but they aren't yours.
You can't repaint, knock down a wall, or even change the art
on the walls.

People spend a lot of time with their software and want it to feel
familiar and home-like.

**Offer people the ability to change the appearance of their software, without
materially affecting the functionality. This is the one time in software design
when it's okay to provide way more options than users need; more than you
think they will even want. Relish it.**

Colors, fonts, font size, borders, pictures, icon styles, cursors, sound effects—all
these can be customized without greatly affecting people's ability to adjust
to a different theme when they need to—for instance when using a shared computer
(see [Computer Places](./computer-places.md)).

Note that customized keybindings
do *not* fall under this pattern, because they change functionality and are difficult
to adjust to. Indeed, I'd guess immutable functionality is nearly as important as
customizable decor to the user's sense of groundedness and "home". We are used to
being able to change our wallpaper, but not the local laws of physics. If functionality
is customizable, the software becomes too abstract, and no longer feels like a
mechanism or a place.

## Examples

- Chrome themes
- WinAmp skins
- Slack color schemes
- Terminal color schemes
- Desktop wallpaper
- Mac OS 9.1 let you change the system font. Mine was Skia for a long time.
- Minecraft texture packs
