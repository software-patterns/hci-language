# The Process of Repair: A Programmer's Manual

## Audience

- junior devs who know one or two programming languages
- what's next, how do I become an awesome programmer?
- can't do much to expand working memory, raw intelligenceâ€”those are limited and roughly the same for all humans
- instead, use working memory more efficiently
- higher-level patterns, not just syntax, control flow, data structures, objects
- a "feel" for the work
- conventional wisdom holds that this feeling cannot be taught directly, from a book
- and indeed the core of the feeling can't be taught
- but the "feel for the code" that a master programmer has is backed up by three other practical elements that
  *can* be taught, without which the feeling is impotent.
  - the ability to "see" the code at a higher level, without focusing on surface details like syntax or even the specific
    language
  - a pattern language of common idioms and ways of structuring code that tend to have good properties
  - a process that incorporates feeling quality, seeing code, and shaping patterns, while continuously delivering
    valuable software.
- besides these three practical skills, the ability to perceive the feeling, which I call Quality, to understand
  where it comes from, and how to use it, are paramount.

- a note on mysticism: this book will no doubt seem like the ramblings of a mystic compared to the precise, pointed,
intellectual approach of other books on software.
- But this mystical feeling arises not because I use arcane, vague language, but because my language is so ordinary.
- My goal is not to cover up the way I actually work with a superstructure of intellectualism. Once you have departed
  from being concerned directly with the bytes processed by the machine, raw intellectualism loses its authority.
- the feeling, seeing, patterns, and process could not be thoroughly analyzed without blowing up this book to many
  times its current length. I doubt you'd read such a book.
- and in any case, the process I actually use, and every master of the craft uses, is only sparsely intellectual.
  It proceeds first by direct feeling, seeing, and experimentation, and only later is intellectual analysis brought
  in to shore up the details.
- as I will explain later, this is the process used by every mechanic, every scientist, and every mathematician.
- it is a timeless process.

## Topics

- techniques for thinking about code
- techniques for achieving quality
- conflicts between existing ideas about quality, how to achieve it
  - context implicit in advice
  - rules become dogma
  - tools, not rules
- quality is in your mind, not the code
  - your own confidence in your code
  - to go fast, you need to trust your code
  - Code Climate can tell you if your code is bad, not if it's good
- quality is evident care
- quality is the external reflection of your own thoughts
- quality is a social mechanism
  - evident care directs attention
  - shared understanding of the code
  - identification of the coder with the code
  - Belonging
