## Introduction

## Feeling Quality

- quote Pirsig's vision of a qualityless world
- misconception that STEM fields are quality-free
- drilled into us in school by the notion that there's a
  "right answer" in math and science, but "no single right
  answer" in Literature and Art.
- some people love the "one right answer" subjects. Those are
  the people who typically become computer programmers.
- but where does the "one right answer" come from?
- science and mathematics do not make progress by rote learning
  of existing right answers. And indeed, the whole concept
  of a "right" answer in math or science is suspect
  - Kuhnian paradigm shifts
  - Non-Euclidean geometry
  - Poincar√©
- all this leads us to suspect that there *is* something
  qualitative about math, science, engineering. But what is it? How
  to see it, create it?
- Quality is "a subtle kind of freedom from internal contradictions" (CA)
  - a harmony between the whole and its parts.
- When you look at the painting of a master, you don't see shading,
  lighting, composition. The painter has mastered these techniques
  and can break the rules. The mastery of each part, frees
  the whole; it leaps forth from the canvas. Before we
  even have had time to analyze it, it impresses us.
- And yet, if we look more closely, and with an analytical eye,
  we see tremendous care and skill evident in each part.
- This care is what frees the whole from being a mere
  agglomeration of parts. There is
  nothing distracting, nothing awkward, no superfluous detail,
  and nothing missing either. Each part exists because it
  supports the whole. Because there are no little out-of-place
  details troubling the parts, they do not trouble us: they
  melt away into insignificance. We feel free to ignore them
  in our appreciation of the whole. But if we do attend to
  the parts, we see the evident care that has been lavished
  on them, and we see that it is just this care that allows
  the feeling of the whole to come into being.
- The same is true of writing. Good writing flows; we get
  caught up in it. We forget about mere words and sentences
  and lose ourselves in the intoxication of meaning. But
  if we do happen to look more closely, we see that this
  flow is created by the care of all the little parts: the
  word order, the insertion of a clause to adjust the timing
  of the sentence, rhythm, how topics are introduced and
  left off and woven back in. And again, it is just this
  care of the parts that frees us from being distracted by
  them, and allows us to be caught up in the whole.
- What can this possibly mean for engineering?
- Few people appreciate code for its own sake. Rare is the person who admires
  a codebase the way they might admire a painting or a symphony.
- Quality in engineering is practical rather than artistic.
- But this is not because Quality in engineering is different from
  Quality in art. Quality is the same everywhere. Engineering quality
  is practical because *engineering* is practical. When
  Quality is found in engineering, it heightens the practicality
  of it just as it heightens the aesthetic experience of art.
