## 2019-02-15: Life vs. Quality

What is life, or aliveness, in an artifact or space? Is it opposed to "quality" as we typically think of quality in software?

See: Worse is Better. Gabriel says products with looser quality standards, that are not built to match an image of perfection
imposed from outside, have better survival characteristics. I.e. they are literally more alive, because they are better
suited to their environments and better able to self-propagate, in the way that all really living things are.

Hypothesis: Alive things are (not definitionally, but incidentally) palimpsests, products of iterative growth whose surface
appearances say something about the processes that shaped them.

Offices with acoustic ceiling tile feel less alive, because the tile is imposed arbitrarily on the space and hides the
underlying structural elements that reveal how the building is put together.
