## 2019-02-20: Outline of a Possible Book

### Introduction

- Known flaws in this book
  - Imperfect metaphors
  - Approaching knowledge through intuition and testing
  - Limits on language
- What is computing?
  - Computation, storage, communication, sensing, signaling
- How do we create software now?
  - XP/"Agile"
  - 3X?
  - Data-driven
  - Lean
  - AI
- Why is change needed?
  - The universe appears absurd from the perspective of the combination of Cartesian dualism + science
    that characterizes post-Enlightenment thought.
  - We think of ourselves as rational beings in a universe of dead matter. This view
    will soon destroy both our environment and our humanity, unless we change it
  - Software engineering is in the eye of the storm. Software is everywhere. If we change, we
    can change the whole of human civilization.
- What is humanizing software?
  - A pattern language (?)
  - A timeless way of programming (?!)
    - Quotes from C.A. to demonstrate parallels
  - Empirical software development
- Why pattern languages?
  - The importance of shared language and vision
- Who can benefit from humanizing software?

### Knitting Computers with Space

- Our pattern languages must begin where C.A.'s end
- Computer systems must interface with physical space
  (not separate, nor entirely suffused) for the system
  containing both to be whole.
- Office layout
- Team structure
- Communication among teams
- Relationship with users and stakeholders
- What to keep from the XP process
- When is it kinder not to react to user feedback?
  - Embrace hacky workarounds
  - Programs that teach
- Versioning, upgrades, and patches
- Software sites

### Programming as Process

- Visualizing the structure of a program
  - Call graph: "top" = main() or other invocation APIs, "bottom" = leaf nodes
  - Horizontal Layers: domain logic on top, application-agnostic (library) code on bottom
  - Vertical slices of input, processing, output (repeated recursively for input and output slices: c.f. the Cantor set!)
  - Tests as pins
- Embarrassingly Obvious Things To Try
  - Get lots of sleep.
  - Take deep breaths.
  - Say "I don't know" or "I'm confused".
  - Take a break.
  - Tell people you value what they do.
- Where should programmers spend their attention?
- Empirical software development

### A Pattern Language for a Program

- (the pattern language)

### What's Next?

- Humanizing Systems or Human Systems or even Living Systems? A generalization of humanizing software?

## 2019-02-15: Life vs. Quality

What is life, or aliveness, in an artifact or space? Is it opposed to "quality" as we typically think of quality in software?

See: Worse is Better. Gabriel says products with looser quality standards, that are not built to match an image of perfection
imposed from outside, have better survival characteristics. I.e. they are literally more alive, because they are better
suited to their environments and better able to self-propagate, in the way that all really living things are.

Hypothesis: Alive things are (not definitionally, but incidentally) palimpsests, products of iterative growth whose surface
appearances say something about the processes that shaped them.

Offices with acoustic ceiling tile feel less alive, because the tile is imposed arbitrarily on the space and hides the
underlying structural elements that reveal how the building is put together.
