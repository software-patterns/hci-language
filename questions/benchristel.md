## Naming concepts that are a blend of old and new

When someone uses a new technique that may be a blend of old and new ideas, they can choose to
discuss it under an old name or a new name. If they use a new name, the continuity with the old
ideas is obscured, and people may have trouble seeing the connection. If they use the old name,
there are several problems:

- people may get into semantic arguments about the old name being misapplied
- people may misunderstand the new concept because of baggage carried forward from the old name
- the new concept may become so popular that it swamps the old usage of the name and makes the
  literature about the old concept harder to understand for someone who is only familiar with
  the new concept.

How can these possibilities be reconciled?

Ideas:

- a "neo-" prefix (compare Neo-Sindarin, Neo-Quenya in Tolkienian linguistics)
- a "prime" suffix as in mathematics
- appending the innovator's name
- appending a letter or number
