## Robert Pirsig, _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_

**p. 16**

> "What's new?" is an interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which, if pursued exclusively,
results only in an endless parade of trivia and fashion, the silt of tomorrow. I would like, instead, to
be concerned with the question "What is best?," a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a
question whose answers tend to move the silt downstream.

**p. 24**

> The "it" is a kind of force that gives rise to technology, something undefined, but inhuman, mechanical,
lifeless, a blind monster, a death force. Something hideous they are running from but know they can never
escape. [. . .] Somewhere there are people who understand it and run it but those are technologists,
and they speak an inhuman language when describing what they do. [. . .] And their things, their monster
keeps eating up the land and polluting the air and lakes, and there is no way to strike back at it, and
hardly any way to escape it.

**p. 25**

> [. . .] the natural feelings of very many people are similar on this matter; so that when you look at
them collectively, as journalists do, you get the illusion of [. . .] an entire political antitechnological
left emerging, looming up from apparently nowhere, saying, "Stop the technology. Have it somewhere else.
Don't have it here." It is still restrained by a thin web of logic that points out that without the
factories there are no jobs or standard of living. But there are human forces stronger than logic. There
always have been, and if they become strong enough in their hatred of technology that web can break.

**p. 26**

> The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears
of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think
otherwise is to demean the Buddhaâ€”which is to demean oneself.
