## Robert Pirsig, _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_

**p. 16**

> "What's new?" is an interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which, if pursued exclusively,
results only in an endless parade of trivia and fashion, the silt of tomorrow. I would like, instead, to
be concerned with the question "What is best?," a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a
question whose answers tend to move the silt downstream.

**p. 24**

> The "it" is a kind of force that gives rise to technology, something undefined, but inhuman, mechanical,
lifeless, a blind monster, a death force. Something hideous they are running from but know they can never
escape. [. . .] Somewhere there are people who understand it and run it but those are technologists,
and they speak an inhuman language when describing what they do. [. . .] And their things, their monster
keeps eating up the land and polluting the air and lakes, and there is no way to strike back at it, and
hardly any way to escape it.

**p. 25**

> [. . .] the natural feelings of very many people are similar on this matter; so that when you look at
them collectively, as journalists do, you get the illusion of [. . .] an entire political antitechnological
left emerging, looming up from apparently nowhere, saying, "Stop the technology. Have it somewhere else.
Don't have it here." It is still restrained by a thin web of logic that points out that without the
factories there are no jobs or standard of living. But there are human forces stronger than logic. There
always have been, and if they become strong enough in their hatred of technology that web can break.

**p. 26**

> The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears
of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think
otherwise is to demean the Buddhaâ€”which is to demean oneself.

**p. 32**

> The shop was a different scene from the ones I remembered. The mechanics, who had once all seemed like
ancient veterans, now looked like children. A radio was going full blast and they were clowning around
and talking and seemed not to notice me. When one of them finally came over he barely listened to the
piston slap before saying, "Oh yeah. Tappets."

> Tappets? I should have known then what was coming.

> After the third overhaul two months later they replaced the cylinders, put in oversize main carburetor
jets, retarded the timing to make it run as coolly as possible and told me, "Don't run it fast."
>
> It was covered with grease and did not start.

**p. 34**

> At 5 P.M. or whenever their eight hours were in, you knew they would cut it off and not have another thought
about their work. They were already trying not to have any thoughts about their work *on* the job. In their
own way they were achieving the same thing John and Sylvia were, living with technology without really having
anything to do with it. [. . .] They were involved in it but not in such a way as to care.

**p. 35**

> When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things.
